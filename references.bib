  abstract = {We present early results regarding the morphological and structural properties of galaxies seen with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at z {$>$} 3 in the Early Release Observations toward the SMACS 0723 cluster field. Using JWST we investigate, for the first time, the optical morphologies of a significant number of z {$>$} 3 galaxies with accurate photometric redshifts in this field to determine the form of galaxy structure in the relatively early universe. We use visual morphologies and Morfometryka measures to perform quantitative morphology measurements, both parametric with light profile fitting (S\'ersic indices) and nonparametric (concentration, asymmetry, and smoothness (CAS) values). Using these, we measure the relative fraction of disk, spheroidal, and peculiar galaxies at 3 {$<$} z {$<$} 8. We discover the surprising result that at z {$>$} 1.5 disk galaxies dominate the overall fraction of morphologies, with a factor of {$\sim$}10 relative higher number of disk galaxies than seen by the Hubble Space Telescope at these redshifts. Our visual morphological estimates of galaxies align closely with their locations in CAS parameter space and their S\'ersic indices.},

  abstract = {Despite consistent progress in numerical simulations, the observable properties of galaxy clusters are difficult to predict ab initio. It is therefore important to compare both theoretical and observational results to a direct measure of the cluster mass. This can be done by measuring the gravitational lensing effects caused by the bending of light by the cluster mass distribution. In this review we discuss how this phenomenon can be used to determine cluster masses and study the mass distribution itself. As sample sizes increase, the accuracy of the weak lensing mass estimates needs to improve accordingly. We discuss the main practical aspects of these measurements. We review a number of applications and highlight some recent results.},

  abstract = {A fundamental feature of galaxies is their structure, yet we are just now understanding the evolution of structural properties in quantitative ways. As such, we explore the quantitative nonparametric structural evolution of 16,778 galaxies up to z {$\sim$} 3 in all five CANDELS fields, the largest collection of high-resolution images of distant galaxies to date. Our goal is to investigate how the structure, as opposed to size, surface brightness, or mass, changes with time. In particular, we investigate how the concentration and asymmetry of light evolve in the rest-frame optical. To interpret our galaxy structure measurements, we also run and analyze 250 simulation realizations from IllustrisTNG to determine the timescale of mergers for the CAS system. We measure that from z = 0\textendash 3, the median asymmetry merger timescale is Gyr, and find that it does not vary with redshift. Using these data, we find that galaxies become progressively asymmetric at a given mass at higher redshifts, and we derive merger rates that scale as Gyr-1, which agrees well with recent machine-learning and galaxy-pair approaches, removing previous inconsistencies. We also show that far-infrared selected galaxies that are invisible to the Hubble Space Telescope have a negligible effect on our measurements. We also find that galaxies are more concentrated at higher redshifts. We interpret this as a sign that their formation occurs from a smaller initial galaxy that later grows into a larger one through mergers, consistent with the size growth of galaxies from the inside out, suggesting that the centers are the oldest parts of most galaxies.},
